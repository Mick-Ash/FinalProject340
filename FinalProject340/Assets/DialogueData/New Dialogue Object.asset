  - 'James:

    VIctoria, you''ve returned. Let me see the coat you bought.'
  - You hand Father the coat.
  - 'James:

    Ah, a men''s coat. Your mother and I have noticed that you have
    bought men''s clothes as of late.'
  - You gather your determination before replying. You tell him that you prefer the
    clothes of men.
  - The reason why? You find that you would rather not be a man nor a woman, but
    yourself.
  - In fact, you tell him that you are not adverse to masculine titles.
  - 'Your is silent as he considers your words. '
