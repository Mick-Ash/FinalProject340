  - 'James:

    VIctoria, you''ve returned. Let me see the coat you bought.'
  - You hand Father the coat. Your clothes feel too tight, anxiety grips your chest
    like a vise.
  - 'James:

    Ah, a men''s coat. Your mother and I have noticed that you have
    bought men''s clothes as of late.'
  - You gather your determination before replying. You tell him that you prefer the
    clothes of men.
  - The reason why? You find that you would rather not be a man nor a woman, but
    yourself.
  - In fact, you tell him that you are not adverse to masculine titles.
  - 'Your father is silent as he considers your words. '
  - He finally speaks.
  - 'James:

    If that is what brings you happiness, my child, then I accept this.'
  - Your confidence renewed, you tell Father about your desire to be an executioner.
  - You have seen the punishments he enacts on the worst men.
  - You have seen your eldest brother, Charles, practice methods of execution.
  - You know that every death of a criminal brings justice. You want to do the same.
  - You say all these things in a torrent of words.
  - The words are only met with silence and the crackling of the fireplace.
  - 'James:

    Do you know what it will take to become Commoner''s Executioner?'
  - You tell him that you do not, but are willing to try everything to gain the position.
  - 'James:

    We will see the Minister of Citizenry in the next fortnight. '
  - 'James:

    In the meantime, I will train you in what you need to know.'
  - 'James:

    Through this, you will know why we are both loved and feared, my
    child.'
  - Being loved and feared all at once sounded reasonable to you...
